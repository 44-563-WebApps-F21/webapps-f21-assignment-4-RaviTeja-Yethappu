   <p class="stage-direction" >[_Refuses coffee_.]  </p> <p class="speech"> But if they’re in love with some
    one who, perhaps, is tied to another?</p>

        <h5 class="name">LADY CAROLINE.</h5>

   <p class="speech">In that case, Lady Stutfield, they should be married off
    in a week to some plain respectable girl, in order to teach them not to
    meddle with other people’s property.</p>

    <h5 class="name">MRS. ALLONBY. </h5>

   <p class="speech">I don’t think that we should ever be spoken of as other
    people’s property.  All men are married women’s property.  That is the
    only true definition of what married women’s property really is.  But we
    don’t belong to any one.

    <h5 class="name">LADY STUTFIELD.</h5>

   <p class="speech"> Oh, I am so very, very glad to hear you say so.</p>
