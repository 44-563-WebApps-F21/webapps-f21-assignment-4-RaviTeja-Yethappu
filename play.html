<h2> A Woman of no Importance </h2>
        <h3> ACT II.  _The Drawing-room at Hunstanton Chase_.
        </h3>
        <p>
            <br> [_Ladies seated on sofas_.] <br>
            MRS. ALLONBY.  What a comfort it is to have got rid of the men for a
little!<br>

LADY STUTFIELD.  Yes; men persecute us dreadfully, don’t they?<br>

MRS. ALLONBY.  Persecute us?  I wish they did.<br>

LADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear!<br>

MRS. ALLONBY.  The annoying thing is that the wretches can be perfectly
happy without us.  That is why I think it is every woman’s duty never to
leave them alone for a single moment, except during this short breathing
space after dinner; without which I believe we poor women would be
absolutely worn to shadows.<br>

[_Enter Servants with coffee_.]<br>

LADY HUNSTANTON.  Worn to shadows, dear?<br>

MRS. ALLONBY.  Yes, Lady Hunstanton.  It is such a strain keeping men up
to the mark.  They are always trying to escape from us.<br>

LADY STUTFIELD.  It seems to me that it is we who are always trying to
escape from them.  Men are so very, very heartless.  They know their
power and use it.<br>

LADY CAROLINE.  [_Takes coffee from Servant_.]  What stuff and nonsense
all this about men is!  The thing to do is to keep men in their proper
place.<br>

MRS. ALLONBY.  But what is their proper place, Lady Caroline?<br>

LADY CAROLINE.  Looking after their wives, Mrs. Allonby.<br>

MRS. ALLONBY.  [_Takes coffee from Servant_.]  Really?  And if they’re
not married?<br>

LADY CAROLINE.  If they are not married, they should be looking after a
wife.  It’s perfectly scandalous the amount of bachelors who are going
about society.  There should be a law passed to compel them all to marry
within twelve months.<br>
