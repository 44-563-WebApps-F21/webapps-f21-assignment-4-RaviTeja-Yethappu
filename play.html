<h2> A Woman of no Importance </h2>
        <h3> ACT II.  _The Drawing-room at Hunstanton Chase_.
        </h3>

            <p> [_Ladies seated on sofas_.] </p>
        <h5>MRS. ALLONBY.</h5>  <p> a comfort it is to have got rid of the men for a
little!</p>

<h5>LADY STUTFIELD.</h5> <p> Yes; men persecute us dreadfully, don’t they?</p>

<h5> ALLONBY. </h5> <p>Persecute us?  I wish they did.</p>

<h5>LADY HUNSTANTON.</h5>  <p> dear!</p>

<h5>MRS. ALLONBY. </h5> <p> annoying thing is that the wretches can be perfectly
happy without us.  That is why I think it is every woman’s duty never to
leave them alone for a single moment, except during this short breathing
space after dinner; without which I believe we poor women would be
absolutely worn to shadows.</p>

        <p>[_Enter Servants with coffee_.]</p>

<h5>LADY HUNSTANTON.</h5>  <p> to shadows, dear?</p>

<h5>MRS. ALLONBY. </h5> <p> Lady Hunstanton.  It is such a strain keeping men up
to the mark.  They are always trying to escape from us.</p>

<h5>LADY STUTFIELD.</h5> <p> It seems to me that it is we who are always trying to
escape from them.  Men are so very, very heartless.  They know their
power and use it.</p>

<h5>LADY CAROLINE.</h5> <p>[_Takes coffee from Servant_.]  What stuff and nonsense
all this about men is!  The thing to do is to keep men in their proper
place.</p>

<h5> ALLONBY.</h5> <p> But what is their proper place, Lady Caroline?</p>

<h5> CAROLINE.</h5> <p> Looking after their wives, Mrs. Allonby.</p>

<h5>MRS. ALLONBY.</h5> <p> [_Takes coffee from Servant_.]  Really?  And if they’re
not married?</p>

<h5>LADY CAROLINE.</h5> <p> If they are not married, they should be looking after a
wife.  It’s perfectly scandalous the amount of bachelors who are going
about society.  There should be a law passed to compel them all to marry
within twelve months.</p>
