<h2> A Woman of no Importance </h2>
        <h3> ACT II.  _The Drawing-room at Hunstanton Chase_.
        </h3>
        <p>
            <p class="stage-direction"> [_Ladies seated on sofas_.] </p>
        <h5 class="name"></class> MRS. ALLONBY.</h5>  <p class="speech"> a comfort it is to have got rid of the men for a
little!</p>

<h5 class="name">LADY STUTFIELD.</h5> <p class="speech"> Yes; men persecute us dreadfully, don’t they?</p>

<h5 class="name"> ALLONBY. </h5> <p class="speech">Persecute us?  I wish they did.</p>

<h5 class="name">LADY HUNSTANTON.</h5> <p class="speech"> dear!</p>

<h5 class="name">MRS. ALLONBY. </h5> <p class="speech"> annoying thing is that the wretches can be perfectly
happy without us.  That is why I think it is every woman’s duty never to
leave them alone for a single moment, except during this short breathing
space after dinner; without which I believe we poor women would be
absolutely worn to shadows.</p>

<p class="stage-direction"> [_Enter Servants with coffee_.]</p>

<h5 class="name">MRS. ALLONBY. </h5> <p class="speech"> Lady Hunstanton.  It is such a strain keeping men up
to the mark.  They are always trying to escape from us.</p>

<h5 class="name">LADY STUTFIELD.</h5> <p class="speech"> It seems to me that it is we who are always trying to
escape from them.  Men are so very, very heartless.  They know their
power and use it.</p>

<h5 class="name">LADY CAROLINE.</h5> <p class="stage-direction">[_Takes coffee from Servant_.]</p>
 <p class="speech">What stuff and nonsense all this about men is!  The thing to do is to keep men in their proper place.</p>

<h5 class="name"> ALLONBY.</h5> <p class="speech"> But what is their proper place, Lady Caroline?</p>

<h5 class="name"> CAROLINE.</h5> <p class="speech"> Looking after their wives, Mrs. Allonby.</p>

<h5 class="name">MRS. ALLONBY.</h5> <p class="stage-direction"> [_Takes coffee from Servant_.] </p> <p class="speech">Really?  And if they’re
not married?</p>

<h5 class="name">LADY CAROLINE.</h5> <p class="speech"> If they are not married, they should be looking after a
wife.  It’s perfectly scandalous the amount of bachelors who are going
about society.  There should be a law passed to compel them all to marry
within twelve months.</p>
